----------------------------------
## Rufaswap
Rufaswap is a simple permuted picture puzzle app where the challenge is to restore the picture elements to their proper place.  Two elements are selected with cursor clicks to initiate a swap.  User controls the level of difficulty by choosing the number of slices, and whether even or irregular.

Works on Windows, Macs running OS-X(>=10.13) and PCs running GNU/Linux.

Simply unzip and run.  If the binary executables do not run on your system then follow the build instructions below.

----------------------------------

 * Uses GLFW3 & OpenAL sound;
 * Works on OS-X Retina displays;
 * all runtime files are in ./data/
 * several png picture files are provided in ./pix/
 * you can use your own png files;

----------------------------------------------
## Run Requirements:
 * graphics card/driver that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;


------------------------------------------------------
## Setup & Running:


Mac users see "osx-setup.txt".
Windows users see "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  On Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this.
The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

Open a commandline terminal, and cd to the install directory.

At the command line, type the executable name to start the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type:

rufaswap.bat (Windows 64-bit)
rufaswap32.bat (Windows 32-bit)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users may type rufaswap_gnu, or double click the icon of rufaswap_gnu in file manager.

The distributed linux executable requires glibc v2.14 or newer.  That means if your distribution is older, it might not run, and you will need to recompile. Or you can try running the windows EXEs under wine:

	* wine cmd < rufaswap.bat
	* wine binw64/rufaswap.exe

Note: I suggest that Windows users DO NOT try running the linux executables under WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux]; that mode is not supported. Simply use the windows version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users note that this game may be initiated in two ways, also.  First, by opening a terminal, navigating to the install_directory, and typing rufaswap_osx on the command line.  Second by navigating to the installation directory in Finder and clicking the "rufaswap.app" icon named "RufasSwap".
 

The install_directory should contain subdirectories named "data", "libs", "pix".


To swap two blocks, click the cursor on them.  The first selection is highlighted, whence you may either click it again to deselect, or click another to swap.

Press (n) or (p) to go to the Next or Previous picture;

Press (m) or (f) to make puzzle harder or easier [More or Fewer slices];
Press (u) to toggle uneven partitions;

Press (esc) to quit.

Note that you can use your own pictures if they are PNG files,  although several photos taken by the author are included.

## what is special about this project?
Uses the Ada programming language and fully modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Achieves version 3.3 core profile contexts.  Compiles and runs on MSwin32, GNU/Linux and Mac OS-X systems.

Focusing on portability and open source freedom, this project relies on a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a homebrew OpanAL binding, & a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine.



----------------------------------------------
## Build Requirement:
 * a recent gnat compiler;
 * Xcode g++ compiler, if using OS-X>=10.13(sep2017)


----------------------------------------------
## Build instructions for Rufaswap

Build scripts for AdaCore Ada [with its own g++] are provided. But should also work for GNAT from the GNU Compiler Collection, with minor changes.

-------------------------------------------------------
msWin32 => wcmp32.bat
or
msWin64 => wcmpa.bat

-------------------------------------------------------
MacOSX => ocmpss.sh:

build script for generating a portable executable that will run on most OS-X platforms whether or not they have non-standard libraries such as GLFW installed.  I used this to build the executable that I deliver, named rufaswap_osx.

------------------------------------------------------
GNU/Linux => lcmpd2.sh:



### Link Problems during linux build:

On a linux build machine, you might have fixable link errors, depending on its configuration.  If you are missing "libz", you can simply copy "libz.so" from the AdaCore ~/lib/ directory into /usr/local/lib/.  If "libGL" cannot be found, this literally means "libGL.so" was absent.  But you might have "libGL.so.1" present.  In this case, simply create a softlink by changing to the libGL directory, then type the line:

sudo ln -s libGL.so.1 libGL.so  (and enter the admin password)

whence the linker should now be able to find what it wants.  But if there is more than one file libGL.so present on your system, make sure you use the best one;  i.e. the one that uses accelerated graphics.
