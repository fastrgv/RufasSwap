https://github.com/fastrgv/RufasSwap/releases/download/v2.6.8/sw7oct23.7z

Type "7z x filename" to extract the archive.

* On OSX, Keka works well for 7Z files. The command-line for Keka is:
	* /Applications/Keka.app/Contents/MacOS/Keka --cli 7z x (filename.7z)



## GitHub Note: Please ignore the "Source code" zip & tar.gz files. (They are auto-generated by GitHub). Click on the large 7z file under releases to download all source & binaries (Windows,Mac & Linux). Then, type "7z x filename" to extract the archive.

----------------------------------
## Rufaswap
Rufaswap is a simple permuted picture puzzle app where the challenge is to restore the picture elements to their proper place.  Two elements are selected with cursor clicks to initiate a swap.  User controls the level of difficulty by choosing the number of slices, and whether even or irregular.

Works on desktops & laptops running Windows, OSX, or Linux.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Featuring

 * no installation
 * no dependencies
 * simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run;
 * or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.
 * Works on HiDpi displays;
 * several png picture files are provided in ./pix/
 * or, you can use your own png files;
-----------------------------------------------------------

## Run Requirements:
 * graphics card/driver that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;


------------------------------------------------------
## Setup & Running:


Mac users see "osx-setup.txt".
Windows users see "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  

* On Linux & Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this. The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

* On OSX, Keka will handle 7z files.  The command-line for Keka works thusly:
	* /Applications/Keka.app/Contents/MacOS/Keka --cli 7z x (filename.7z)

After the archive is unzipped...

Open a commandline terminal, and cd to the install directory.

At the command line, type the executable name to start the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users type:

	rufaswap_osx

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type:

rufaswap.bat (Windows 64-bit)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux users may type:
	rufaswap_gnu, 

or double click the icon of rufaswap in file manager.

You can also run the windows EXEs under wine thusly:

	* wine cmd < rufaswap.bat, or
	* wine binw32/rufaswap.exe

Note: Windows users should NOT try running the linux executables under WSL [Windows Subsystem for Linux]; that mode is not supported. Simply use the windows version.

**If an older Linux system complains that /dev/dsp/ cannot be opened, prepend the command with "padsp",EG:  "padsp (ExeName)".**



-------------------------------------------------------------------

	The install_directory should contain subdirectories named "data", "libs", "pix".


To swap two blocks, click the cursor on them.  The first selection is highlighted, whence you may either click it again to deselect, or click another to swap.

Press (n) or (p) to go to the Next or Previous picture;

Press (m) or (f) to make puzzle harder or easier [More or Fewer slices];
Press (u) to toggle uneven partitions;

Press (esc) to quit.

Note that you can use your own pictures if they are PNG files,  although several photos taken by the author are included.

## what is special about this project?
Uses the Ada programming language and fully modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Achieves version 3.3 core profile contexts.  Compiles and runs on MSwin32, GNU/Linux systems.

Focusing on portability and open source freedom, this project relies on a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a homebrew OpanAL binding, & a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine that uses Dmitriy Anisimkov's Zlib for Ada.



----------------------------------------------
## Build Requirement:
 * a recent Ada compiler;

See:
	* https://github.com/alire-project/GNAT-FSF-builds/releases
